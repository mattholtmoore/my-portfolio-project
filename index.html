    <div>
      <p>
        I've had a plethora of great learning experiences throughout my career. Each one teaching me more about myself and how to communicate and care for the people I encounter. Whether that was preparing and cooking meals, working a cash register, loading vehicles, processing and ordering inventory, operating heavy machinery, or singing into a microphone both live and in recording studios - the collective of experiences has shaped me to have confidence and connectivity in any environment. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Most recently, I've had the great honor of serving as a Worship Experience Director at Elevation Church. This allowed for a lot of amazing opportunities to grow my talents and share them with others. I was able to adopt a lot of knowledge about the culture of a team and what it takes to keep it healthy. I was able to oversee and manage a team, supporting them in both their personal and professional lives. I was equally challenged and encouraged. I was able to take the things I've learned along the way and cultivate great relational equity as well as produce long-lasting impact and investment.
      </p> 
      <br> 
      <p>
        Now I'm on a journey to take what I've learned from those experiences, establish new ones, and see how they all translate for what's ahead for my family.
