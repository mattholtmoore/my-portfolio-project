      <p>
        I've had a plethora of great learning experiences throughout my career. Each one teaching me more about myself
        and how to communicate and care for the people I encounter. Whether that was preparing and cooking meals,
        working a cash register, loading vehicles, processing and ordering inventory, operating heavy machinery, or
        singing into a microphone both live and in recording studios - the collective of experiences has shaped me to
        have confidence and connectivity in any environment.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Most recently, I've had the great honor of serving as a Worship Experience Director at Elevation Church. This
        allowed for a lot of amazing opportunities to grow my talents and share them with others. I was able to adopt a
        lot of knowledge about the culture of a team and what it takes to keep it healthy. I was able to oversee and
        manage a team, supporting them in both their personal and professional lives. I was equally challenged and
        encouraged. I was able to take the things I've learned along the way and cultivate great relational equity as
        well as produce long-lasting impact and investment.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Now I'm on a journey to take what I've learned from those experiences, establish new ones, and see how they all
        translate for what's ahead for my family.
