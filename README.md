## Description

This is a dedicated portfolio page to let you know who I am and how to contact me. It is a small snippet into my life and work. In the body, you'll see an About Me that lets you know who I am and what I do. You'll also find a work section with a link to a few of my recent projects. Towards the bottom of the page you'll see my contact information, along with links to my GitHub and my LinkedIn accounts.
