## Description
This project is a small snippet of my life and current work. It's a way to get to know me and know how to contact me. In the body, you'll see an About Me that lets you know who I am and what I do. You'll also find a work section with a link to one of my recent projects and a couple "coming soon" links. Towards the bottom of the page you'll see my contact information, along with links to my GitHub and my LinkedIn accounts.
